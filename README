A Calculus of Constructions GUI term constructor

To run: You need Python 3.* installed (I'm not sure if all subversions work; I
tested this with Python 3.2). Then simply run "python loader_gui.py" in the
command line. You need to PIP package pyperclip installed for full
functionality.

The files busy.tar.gz and loader.c were made by Ralph Loader. busy.tar.gz was
downloaded from http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~suckfish/busy/busy.tar.gz, and is
linked from his homepage at http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~suckfish/. loader.c is
copied from reduced.c in the tarfile busy.tar.gz. These files are both public
domain (source: personal correspondence).
